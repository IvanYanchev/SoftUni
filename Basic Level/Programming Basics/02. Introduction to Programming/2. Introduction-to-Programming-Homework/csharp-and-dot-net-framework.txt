C# is a .NET based/developed language - its a language used to develop on the .NET platform and is available through .NET framework.
.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model 
corresponds to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just 
by using .NET libraries). The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other 
languages to write .NET applications.
